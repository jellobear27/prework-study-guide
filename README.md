## Description

- My motivation was to become familiarized with the basic fundamentals of beginner code before class starts. 
- I built this project to allow me to see html, css and javascript in action. 
- This solves the problem of me being cluless on day 1.
- I learned that debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process and that it's important to get into the mindset that errors and mistakes are gifts that tell me when something is wrong and if I can stay curious, I will figure out what is happening and learn something new.
